All endpoints: ‚úÖ Responding correctly
Communication: ‚úÖ Frontend-backend verified working
```

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ All HTTP endpoints
- ‚úÖ Session management
- ‚úÖ AI pipeline with fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Recommendation engine
- ‚úÖ Admin monitoring
- ‚úÖ Security (Helmet, CORS, sessions)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: API Key Security

**You shared an OpenAI API key in the chat.**

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
2. DELETE the exposed key immediately
3. Generate a NEW key
4. Update .env with the new key

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### To Get Full Functionality (Option 1)
```bash
# 1. Get real API keys
# - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# - Google Vision: https://cloud.google.com/vision

# 2. Update .env file with real keys

# 3. Restart servers
npm run dev  # Backend
PORT=3001 npm start  # Frontend (in frontend directory)

# 4. Test with real bookshelf photos
```

### To Deploy to Production (Option 2)
```bash
# 1. Add real API keys to .env
# 2. Run deployment prep
npm run deploy:prep

# 3. Deploy to Vercel
npm run deploy

# 4. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

### To Optimize GitHub Profile (Option 3)
1. Use the enhanced README from the analysis
2. Add technology badges
3. Include live demo link
4. Update repository description
5. Add GitHub topics: ai, machine-learning, recommendation-system, etc.
