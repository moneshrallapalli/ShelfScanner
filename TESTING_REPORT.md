2. **Configure Database** - Set up PostgreSQL connection
3. **Enable HTTPS** - Configure SSL certificates
4. **Set Production URLs** - Update FRONTEND_URL
5. **Configure CORS** - Restrict to production domain
6. **Set Strong SESSION_SECRET** - Use cryptographically secure key

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Error Tracking** - Integrate Sentry or similar
2. **Performance Monitoring** - Add APM (New Relic, DataDog)
3. **Logging** - Centralized log aggregation (ELK stack)
4. **Caching** - Redis for distributed caching
5. **Database** - Connection pooling, read replicas
6. **CDN** - CloudFlare or similar for static assets
7. **Monitoring** - Health check monitoring and alerting
