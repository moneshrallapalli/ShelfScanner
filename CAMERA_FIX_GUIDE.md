## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Camera Permission Denied"

**Symptoms:**
- Permission dialog appears but you click "Block"
- Camera light doesn't turn on
- Error: "NotAllowedError"

**Solution:**
1. Check your browser's camera permissions
2. Reset permission (see above)
3. Reload the page
4. Click "Allow" when prompted

---

### Issue 2: "Camera Not Starting"

**Symptoms:**
- Click "Start Camera" but nothing happens
- No error message
- Camera light doesn't turn on

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Try these:
   - Refresh the page
   - Close and reopen browser tab
   - Restart your browser
   - Check if another app is using camera

---

### Issue 3: "Video Feed Shows But Black Screen"

**Symptoms:**
- Camera starts but shows black/blank video
- Camera light is on
- No "Capture Photo" button

**Solution:**
1. Wait 2-3 seconds for video to initialize
2. Try clicking "Stop Camera" then "Start Camera" again
3. Check camera permissions are fully granted
4. Verify camera isn't blocked by privacy settings
5. Try a different application to test camera (Photo app, etc.)

---

### Issue 4: "Can't Click Capture Photo"

**Symptoms:**
- Video is displaying
- But "Capture Photo" button doesn't appear
- Or button is disabled/grayed out

**Solution:**
1. This usually means video isn't fully loaded
2. Wait a few more seconds
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check console for errors (F12)
5. If video shows, the capture should work

---

### Issue 5: "Photo Captured But Blank"

**Symptoms:**
- Capture succeeds
- But captured image is black/blank
- Error in console about canvas

**Solution:**
1. Video wasn't ready when you captured
2. Try again after waiting longer for video to load
3. Check browser console for specific errors
4. Try different lighting conditions

---

### Issue 6: "Camera Works But No Books Detected"

**Symptoms:**
- Can capture photos successfully
- Analysis starts
- But shows "No books detected"

**Solution:**
This is expected with mock data! The system:
- Falls back to rule-based recommendations
- Shows what would happen with real API keys
- Still demonstrates the full flow

When you add real API keys:
- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision will actually analyze the image
- Google Vision will detect books in the photo
- Results will be accurate to your real bookshelf

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check Browser Console

To see detailed error messages:

1. **Open Developer Tools:**
   - Chrome/Edge: Press F12 or Cmd+Option+I
   - Firefox: Press F12 or Cmd+Option+I
   - Safari: Develop ‚Üí Show Web Inspector

2. **Go to Console tab**

3. **Look for messages starting with:**
   - `‚úÖ` = Success messages
   - `‚ùå` = Error messages
   - `Error accessing camera:` = Permission/hardware issue

### Common Console Messages

**Good:**
```
‚úÖ Photo captured successfully
Camera started and streaming
```

**Bad:**
```
Error accessing camera: NotAllowedError
navigator.mediaDevices is not available
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use good lighting**
   - Bright, natural light preferred
   - Avoid harsh shadows on book spines

2. **Hold camera steady**
   - Use both hands if possible
   - Avoid camera shake

3. **Frame the bookshelf well**
